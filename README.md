# SFML Framework v0.2.2

This project is C++ framework, based on SFML library (you need to instal SFML lib). This is a game development framework.

It's my project from 07/2018 right now I don't have time to continue this project because I need make some very important projects. I belive that someday I'll come back to this project and end this.
